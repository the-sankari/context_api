# State Management Introduction â€“ useContext
In Week 1, we learned about prop drilling and its limitations. In Week 2, we'll explore how React's Context API and useContext can help us avoid prop drilling by providing a more efficient way to pass data between components.

## Topics to Learn:
* React Context API: How to create a global state that can be accessed by any component.
* useContext Hook: Consuming global state without needing to pass props.
Solving the Prop Drilling Problem: Refactoring the To-Do app using useContext.
* Project: Refactoring the To-Do List App Using Context
We will refactor the To-Do List App from Week 1 to use the Context API for state management. This will allow us to avoid passing props through multiple components (prop drilling).
